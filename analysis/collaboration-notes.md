# SHAM Collaboration Notes

## Document Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Code Extraction
- Extract HTML/CSS from V1-1
- Extract Vue.js components from V1-2  
- Extract advanced features from V1-3
- Extract spatial analysis from V1-4
- Extract optimizations from V1-5
- Extract AI algorithms from V1-6

### Phase 2: Organization
- Create modular file structure
- Separate concerns (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Organize components by functionality
- Document API interfaces

### Phase 3: Data Integration
- Connect CSV datasets to application
- Implement data loading pipelines
- Create visualization workflows
- Add real-time analysis capabilities

### Phase 4: Collaborative Development
- Set up feature branches
- Create testing framework
- Establish code review process
- Document deployment procedures

## Next Steps
1. Manual PDF code extraction
2. File organization and modularization
3. Data pipeline implementation
4. Collaborative workflow setup
